/*
 * Drives the real built bundle outside a browser.
 *
 *     npm run build && npm run smoke
 *
 * What it does: installs the DOM and the platform globals, loads
 * `out/controls/AuditHistory/bundle.js` the way a form would, drives the control
 * through the states a form can put it in, and asserts what it did.
 *
 * Why it exists alongside `npm start` and `dev/harness.html`: both of those
 * *show* you the control, and the states that matter most are ones nobody
 * thinks to look at — a column the user cannot read, a business rule that
 * failed, a host with no column metadata, a cleared value that has to travel
 * back as `null` rather than `undefined`. Those are decisions, they are what
 * regresses, and here they are assertions with an exit code.
 *
 * Why no test framework: there is none in this repository, and adding one to
 * run a handful of assertions against a bundle would be a dependency, a config
 * file and a second build pipeline for something `node` already does. It also
 * runs the **built bundle** rather than the TypeScript sources, which is the
 * part worth checking — webpack, the externals and the manifest all sit between
 * the source and what a form actually loads. CI runs it after the msbuild pack,
 * so there it drives the production bundle.
 *
 * **What passing here does NOT mean.** Every value below is supplied by this
 * file. It cannot tell you that the control looks right, that the stylesheet
 * applies, that focus order works, that a real form hands down what these
 * fixtures hand down, or that a save persists anything. Keep the answers to
 * those in SPEC.md under "Not verified".
 *
 * **If the bundle will not load here at all**, because it carries a browser
 * application that reads `document` at module scope — a Monaco, a map, a
 * charting library — do not grow `dom.js` to meet it. Keep the control's
 * decisions in modules that import nothing of the library, and drive those
 * instead: `pcf-code-editor`'s `dev/smoke.js` transpiles them with the
 * TypeScript already in devDependencies and refuses one that imports the
 * library. The skill has the shape under *When the bundle cannot load in
 * Node*.
 *
 * **And a stub must never be more capable than the thing it stands in for.**
 * `dev/host.js` withholds `security`, `attributes` and `fluentDesignLanguage`
 * exactly where the platform withholds them. When you add to it, stub the
 * refusals first — the argument the call requires, the field it omits, the
 * empty collection it hands back. If you cannot say what the real call
 * withholds, the stub is a guess and the assertions resting on it prove
 * nothing.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **The assertions below the divider are a worked example. Replace them.**
 * Everything above the divider is plumbing that works for any field control;
 * the examples exercise the scaffolded control and are meant to be thrown away
 * with it.

 * **Keep this when the worked example above goes.** It is written against no
 * particular control and needs no knowledge of what yours takes.
 *
 * `destroy` is the lifecycle method with nothing visible riding on it, so it is
 * the one that quietly does nothing. A control that takes an interval, a
 * `requestAnimationFrame` loop, or a listener on `document` or `window` owes
 * each of them back — and none of the three shows up on a form. The interval
 * keeps firing against a container the platform has already thrown away; the
 * document listener keeps the whole control reachable, so nothing about it is
 * ever collected. On a form somebody leaves open all afternoon, or a subgrid
 * that re-renders its rows, they accumulate.
 *
 * Counting before and after is the whole trick. The scaffolded control takes
 * neither, so both numbers are zero and this passes trivially — which is the
 * point: it starts passing for a real reason the moment somebody adds a timer,
 * and fails the moment they forget the other half.
